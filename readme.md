It's a simple plugin for sublime which is a formatter for verilog using verible.

Please unzip verible and add its path to env, so this plugin can use that.

You can triger format by `F11`(default) or `Edit->Line->Format with Verible`

If you have any question, please contract me through 1173368667@qq.com.
