It's a simple plugin for sublime which is a formatter for verilog using verible.

Please unzip verible and add its path to env. Then put this folder to `Sublime4\Data\Packages` and file `verible_formatter_sublime.sublime-settings` to `Sublime4\Data\Packages\User`, Sublime will auto load this plugin.

To edit setting and shortcut, please edit `Default (Windows).sublime-keymap` in this folder and `verible_formatter_sublime.sublime-settings` in `Sublime4\Data\Packages\User`.

If you have any question, please contract me through 1173368667@qq.com.
